`benchmarks` is a free and open-source project aiming to compare the speeds of various programming languages across different tasks.
Built with Kotlin/JVM from the ground up, this project is designed to be easy to use, simple to navigate, and great to contribute to.

These are in no way perfect benchmarks, and should not be taken as the final word on the speed of a language. 
The benchmarks are meant to be a general comparison between languages, and should not be used to determine **highly precise**
performance metrics.

## Contributing

Contributors are always welcome. The more benchmarks, the better!

If you would like to contribute to this repository, please read the [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/gmitch215/benchmarks/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) file.
It covers the process of adding new benchmarks, updating existing benchmarks, and general guidelines for contributing to the project.
