# Contributing

Contributing guidelines for benchmarks. We appreciate your help in helping us to improve the project.

## New Benchmarks

New Benchmarks are always welcome. However, make sure that they can apply to a wide range of languages and are not too specific to one or a few languages.

In addition, we want to avoid using external libraries as much as possible. If you need to use an external library, please provide a detailed explanation of why it is absolutely necessary.

1.) Please submit an issue with the new benchmark you would like to add and explain it in detail, providing an example implementation in a language of your choice, if possble.

2.) We will review and approve the issue as soon as possible.

3.) Once the issue is approved, we will issue a pull request to add the new benchmark.

We will approve and merge your addition as soon as possible if these requirements are met.

## Pull Request Process

1.) Ensure that the pull request is at the correct branch you want to merge in.

2.) Ensure that your new code has been tested and works properly.

3.) Confirm that the code is ready to be merged along with any documentation you intend to include.

We will approve and merge your pull request as soon as possible if these requirements are met.
